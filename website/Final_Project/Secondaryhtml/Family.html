      <p>I would like you to meet my family! In the image below we have a picture of my Mother and Father as well as my Sister. My parents and I live together in Greenville, Ohio in a small sub-division. We love going out to family get togethers, as well as our local High School sporting events. It is important that I spend as much time with them now as ever because soon I will be moving out to explore the world for myself.</p>
