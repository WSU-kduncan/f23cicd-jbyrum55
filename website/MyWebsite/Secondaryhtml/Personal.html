      <p>This is Me! This was a picture of when I got my very first motorcycle. My Dad has always had a Harley and me being the obnoxious teen I was wanted to get a sports bike to go on rides with him. This is a great Father-Son bonding activity even though we do not even talk. My Father has always been my inspiration growing up and it is moments like these that I will cherish forever.</p>
