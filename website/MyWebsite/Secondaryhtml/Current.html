      <p>This is what I do. Currently day to day I work full-time at Walmart where I have made many friends that I never thought I would have made. I also have my own tiny mowing business where I mow seven lawns a week. When I am not tied up working, I love hanging out with my friends on the weekends and going on little trips with my family. The picture below was taken when we were on our way to Tennessee to enjoy the great weather.</p>
