    <h2>How I Want To Be Remembered!</h2>
    <div class="content-box">
      <p>I would like to be remembered as a loving and caring friend, brother, son, husband, and dad. I would like to think that I would do anything for anybody that I love and that they would do the same for me. I try to be the best person that I can be on a daily basis, to help others and put them before myself. There are times that I can be greedy and mean I'm sure, but I hope that all the good outweighs the bad. </p>
